## Files

### Server (tftpserver.c)

- Start the server with the command: `tftpserver <Directory Address> <Port>`, specifying the listening port.
- While the directory address is given in the input, the server only sends files to the client if they are in the same dirctory as the server
- The server provides both RRQ and WRQ. 

### `include.h`

- Header file with function declarations and constants used throughout the codebase.

## Directory Structure

- `bin`: Contains the compiled binary executables.
- `include`: Houses the `common.h` header file.
- `obj`: Stores the object files generated during compilation.
- `src`: Contains the source code files for the server and client.

## Building and Running

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Optionally clean the project: `make clean`.

3. Compile the code and generate the binaries: `make -f Makefile`.

4. Start the server with the command: `tftpserver <Directory Address> <Port>`, specifying the listening port.

## ChatGPT Code Enhancement

### 1. gpt-gen

This directory contains code generated by ChatGPT in response to the initial question prompt. The code provided here is based on the initial request without any modifications or improvements.

### 2. gpt-improved

This directory contains code that has been improved and refined by incorporating better practices, readability enhancements, and optimizations. The code in this directory represents a refined version of the code initially generated by the Team.
