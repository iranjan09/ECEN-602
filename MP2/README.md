# Network Programming Assignment 2 - SBCP Chat Server and Client

## Introduction

This project extends the functionality of Assignment 1 by implementing a Simple Broadcast Chat Protocol (SBCP) chat service consisting of a server and a client. The server manages a global chat session, allowing clients to join, leave, and send and receive messages. The assignment also includes bonus features such as IPV6 suppor, new message types (ACK, NAK, ONLINE, and OFFLINE) and and detect idle clients.

## Files

### Server (server.c)

- Start the server with the command: `server <IP Address> <Port> <Client number>`, specifying the listening port.
- The server supports multiple simultaneous connections.
- Server can Jlet client JOIN the chat session, SEND messages between them, and inform about detect idle clients.
- The server handles ACK, NAK, ONLINE, and OFFLINE messages, providing a robust chat experience.

### Client (client.c)

- Run the client using the command: `client <username> <IP Address> <Port>`, specifying the server's IP address and port.
- Clients can JOIN the chat session, SEND messages, and detect idle clients.
- The client handles ACK, NAK, FWD messages from the server.
- The client can handle both user input and server messages simulataneously.

### `common.h`

- Header file with function declarations and constants used throughout the codebase.

## Directory Structure

- `bin`: Contains the compiled binary executables.
- `include`: Houses the `common.h` header file.
- `obj`: Stores the object files generated during compilation.
- `src`: Contains the source code files for the server and client.

## Building and Running

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Optionally clean the project: `make clean`.

3. Compile the code and generate the binaries: `make -f Makefile`.

4. Start the server with the command: `server <IP Address> <Port> <Client number>`, replacing `<IP Address>` and `<Port>` with the desired listening por and `<Client number>` with total clients supported.

5. Launch the client with: `./client <Client Username> <Server IP Address> <Server Port>`, providing the server's IP address and port and Client Username.

## ChatGPT Code Enhancement

### 1. gpt-gen

This directory contains code generated by ChatGPT in response to the initial question prompt. The code provided here is based on the initial request without any modifications or improvements.

### 2. gpt-improved

This directory contains code that has been improved and refined by incorporating better practices, readability enhancements, and optimizations. The code in this directory represents a refined version of the code initially generated by the Team.

In Assignment 2, we have enhanced the chat service to support the SBCP protocol, offering a more sophisticated chat experience with additional features and protocol handling.
