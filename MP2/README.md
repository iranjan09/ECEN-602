# Network Programming Assignment 2 - SBCP Chat Server and Client

## Introduction

This project extends the functionality of Assignment 1 by implementing a Simple Broadcast Chat Protocol (SBCP) chat service consisting of a server and a client. The server manages a global chat session, allowing clients to join, leave, view members, send and receive messages, and detect idle clients. The assignment also includes bonus features such as IPV6 support and new message types (ACK, NAK, ONLINE, and OFFLINE).

## Files

### Server (server.c)

- Start the server with the command: `echos <Port>`, specifying the listening port.
- The server supports multiple simultaneous connections.
- Clients can JOIN the chat session, SEND messages, and detect idle clients.
- The server handles ACK, NAK, ONLINE, and OFFLINE messages, providing a robust chat experience.

### Client (client.c)

- Run the client using the command: `echo <IP Address> <Port>`, specifying the server's IP address and port.
- Clients can JOIN the chat session, SEND messages, and detect idle clients.
- The client gracefully exits upon user input (e.g., Control-D), sending OFFLINE messages to the server.

### `common.c`

- Contains common functions shared between the server and client.
- Includes functions for reading and writing data on sockets, as well as SBCP message handling.

### `common.h`

- Header file with function declarations and constants used throughout the codebase.

## Directory Structure

- `bin`: Contains the compiled binary executables.
- `include`: Houses the `common.h` header file.
- `obj`: Stores the object files generated during compilation.
- `src`: Contains the source code files for the server and client.

## Building and Running

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Optionally clean the project: `make clean`.

3. Compile the code and generate the binaries: `make -f Makefile`.

4. Start the server with the command: `./echos <Port>`, replacing `<Port>` with the desired listening port.

5. Launch the client with: `./echo <IP Address> <Port>`, providing the server's IP address and port.

## ChatGPT Code Enhancement

### 1. gpt-gen

This directory contains code generated by ChatGPT in response to the initial question prompt. The code provided here is based on the initial request without any modifications or improvements.

### 2. gpt-improved

This directory contains code that has been improved and refined by incorporating better practices, readability enhancements, and optimizations. The code in this directory represents a refined version of the code initially generated by the Team.

In Assignment 2, we have enhanced the chat service to support the SBCP protocol, offering a more sophisticated chat experience with additional features and protocol handling.
